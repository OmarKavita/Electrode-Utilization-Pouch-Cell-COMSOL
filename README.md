# Electrode-Utilization-Pouch-Cell-COMSOL
* Analysed lithium-ion battery degradation data to study state of charge(SOC) variation and degradation trend across thousants of cycles.
* Performed regression analysis and done feature engineering on cycle level indicators to capture degradation patterns.
* Build and optimized SOC forecasting models (LightGBM, LSTM) using the Dart time-series library with Optuna hyperparametric tuning.
